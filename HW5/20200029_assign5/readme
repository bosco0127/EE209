 I do this assignment by myself.
 I only refer to lecture note, and get information about sprintf from TA.
 I spent about 24hours: 8hours each, total 3days.
 This assignment is the first assignment that I could not implement all the
required function. I think I am lack of understanding implementation of back
-ground process and foreground process. Also I could not implement lexcial
analysis. I only implement about space characters, and failed to implement
quatation mark. For these reason I disappointed a lot to myself.
 Also, I failed to implemet all the extra credit.
 Last, I want to get a answer code of this assignment to understand how to implement
the rest of the function that I failed to implement. If you do not mind,
please send me the answer code of this assignment to my email address:

 Thank you for this whole semester. See you soon.
